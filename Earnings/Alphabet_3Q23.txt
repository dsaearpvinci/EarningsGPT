Alphabet's financial results for the third quarter showed several key aspects:

Revenue Growth: Alphabet reported consolidated revenues of $76.7 billion, marking an 11% increase in both reported and constant currency terms. Search continued to be the largest contributor to this revenue growth.

Expense Management: Total cost of revenues was $33.2 billion, up by 7%. This increase was primarily due to other costs of revenues, which rose by 6%, mainly driven by content acquisition costs for YouTube subscription offerings. A notable factor was the reduction in depreciation expense due to a change in estimated useful lives.

Solid Segment Performances: The financial results were positively influenced by meaningful growth in Search and YouTube, as well as momentum in Cloud. Google Services revenues were $68 billion, up 11%, and the Google Cloud segment reported revenues of $8.4 billion, a 22% increase. This reflects strong growth across various industries and products.

Financial Stability: Alphabet's financial stability was evident with $22.6 billion in free cash flow for the quarter and $78 billion for the trailing 12 months. They ended the quarter with $120 billion in cash and marketable securities.

Profitability: Operating income for the quarter was $21.3 billion, up 25% with an operating margin of 28%. Net income was reported at $19.7 billion, benefiting from an effective tax rate of 7% due to an IRS change related to the use of foreign tax credits.

In assessing the economic outlook, Alphabet expressed satisfaction with its current performance, especially considering the historic volatility in the advertising sector. They remain focused on managing expenses and optimizing resources to support growth, particularly in areas like AI, while maintaining financial stability and profitability.
