Meta's financial results for the third quarter demonstrated several key points:

Revenue and Expense Trends: Meta reported a total revenue of $34.1 billion, which was up by 23% or 21% on a constant currency basis compared to the previous year. Total expenses were $20.4 billion, reflecting a 7% decrease from the previous year. The cost of revenue increased by 9%, primarily due to higher infrastructure-related costs, partly offset by lower content costs.

Operating Margin: The company achieved its highest operating margin in two years, demonstrating efficiency in its operations despite ongoing investments for future growth.

Segment Performance: The Family of Apps (FoA) segment saw a decrease in expenses by 9%, attributed to lower legal, marketing, and headcount-related costs. The operating income for this segment was $17.5 billion, representing a 52% operating margin. In contrast, the Reality Labs segment faced a decline in revenue by 26%, primarily due to lower Quest 2 sales, with an operating loss of $3.7 billion.

Cost Management: Research and Development (R&D) expenses increased by 1%, balanced by lower non-headcount related operating expenses. Marketing and Sales expenses decreased by 24%, mainly due to reduced marketing spend and headcount costs. General and Administrative (G&A) expenses saw a significant reduction of 39%, primarily due to lower legal-related expenses.

Net Income and Capital Expenditure: Meta recorded a net income of $11.6 billion or $4.39 per share. The company's capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, were $6.8 billion, driven by investments in servers, data centers, and network infrastructure.

In assessing the economic outlook, Meta emphasized the importance of delivering engaging experiences for its community and effectively monetizing that engagement over time. The company noted strong overall engagement on Facebook and Instagram, with Reels and video content continuing to drive incremental engagement.
